# Obsession with Primitives

Most programming environments are built around a widely used set of primitive types: integers, floating-point numbers, and strings. We've noticed that many programmers are curiously reluctant to create their own fundamental types that are useful for their domain.

There are a few patterns to apply in this refactoring:

* Replace Primitive with Object
* Replace Type Code with SubClasses
* Replace Conditional with Polymorphism
* Extract Class
* Introduce Parameter Object
