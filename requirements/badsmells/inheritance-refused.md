# Inheritance Refused

Subclasses inherit methods and data from their parents. But what if they don't want or need what they're given? They receive all these wonderful gifts and choose just a few to use.

There are a few patterns to apply in this refactoring:

* Push Down Method
* Push Down Field
* Replace Subclass with Delegate
* Replace Superclass with Delegate
