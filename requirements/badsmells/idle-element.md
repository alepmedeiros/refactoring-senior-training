# Idle Element

Classes or methods that, when developed, we thought would have a large proportion later on, but it ended up not doing what we expected, getting little used, and sometimes not even being used anymore.

There are a few patterns to apply in this refactoring:

* Inline Function
* Inline Class
* Collapse Hierarchy
