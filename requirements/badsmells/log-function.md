# Long Method

Programs that live better and longer are those that have small methods. Long methods generate development costs, as they are difficult to maintain and have a good understanding of.

There are a few patterns to apply in this refactoring:

* Extract Method.
* Replace Temp with Query.
* Introduce Parameter Object.
* Preserve Whole Object.
* Replace Method with COmmand.
* Replace Conditional with Polymorphism.
* Split Loop.
