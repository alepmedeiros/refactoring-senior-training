# Rifle Surgery

Rifle surgery is similar to a divergent alteration, but the opposite. You will smell it when, whenever you make a change, you have to make several small changes in several different classes. When altars are everywhere, they are hard to find, and it will be easy to miss an important modification.

There are a few patterns to apply in this refactoring:

* Move Method
* Move Field
* Combine Method into Class
* Combine method into Transform
* Split Phase
* Inline Method
* Inline Class
