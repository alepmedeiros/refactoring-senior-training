# Speculative Generality

We smell a stench that we're very sensitive to, where we get it when people say, "Oh, I think we need this sort of thing someday," and then add all sorts of hooks and special cases to handle cases that aren't. needed. The result is often more difficult to understand and more difficult to maintain. If all these features were being used, it would be worth it.

There are a few patterns to apply in this refactoring:

* Collapse Herarchy
* Inline Function
* Inline Class
* Change Function Declaration
* Remove Dead Code
