> ### Pushing Changes to GitHub

So let’s say you’ve made the changes necessary to implement the specific feature or enhancement (the one “logical change”), and you’ve committed the changes to your local repository. The next step is to push those changes back up to GitHub.

As you will be working on the branch named develop, determined in this documentation, just run this command:

```bash
git push origin develop
```
