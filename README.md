### Legacy Code
>
* Is your code easy to change?
* Do you get near-instant feedback when you change it? 
* Do you understand?

If your answer to these questions is "no", you have legacy code and it is consuming time and money from your development.

> There are several patterns that can be applied in the refactoring of your code, and these patterns we will be applying in this project, and I believe it will help many to give more useful life to their legacy projects, more performance, more functionality, more reliability and more ability to management.

> The main reason for code refactoring is to improve the maintainability of the software, as well as to make existing code easier to understand.
> * Understand the process and principles of refactoring.
> * Quickly apply convenient refactorings to make a program easier to understand and easier to change.
> * Recognize "bad smells" in code that signal opportunities
 to refactor.
> * Explore the refactorings, each with its own explanation, mechanism.
> * Write robust tests or your refactorings.
